    <h1>What are oil spills?</h1>
  
    <p>Oil is an ancient fossil fuel that we use to heat our homes, generate electricity, and power large sectors of our economy. But when oil accidentally spills into the ocean, it can cause big problems. Oil spills can harm sea creatures, ruin a day at the beach, and make seafood unsafe to eat. It takes sound science to clean up the oil, measure the impacts of pollution, and help the ocean recover.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>The oil the animals digest is highly toxic. During the oil spill, the birds and mammals can digest the oil accidentally, for example, the food they eat, the air, and when they are cleaning their feathers/fur. This can causes a flow on affect for the birds and mammals problems like neurological damage or cancer. For example, the fossil fuels that are produced by factories can lead to negative effects in our atmosphere, what fossil fuels do to our body are similar, heart attacks, respiratory disorders, stroke and asthma.  This doesn't just only affect us, this also affects our sea environment with all the toxins that are in the oil.</p>

    <h1>Fact</h1>
    <h3> The oil spill was called the gulf of Mexico oil spill. This was the largest oil spill in history. The date was april 20th, 2010. The natural gas had traveled up the deep waters rig and raised to the platform where it had exploded, killing 11 workers and injuring 17.</h3>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>Firstly, we should lower the amount of oil transported and have more employees on the ship. Not only this, but we also should be decreasing the amount of oil used overall in factories. This could prevent the number of fossil fuels used and spilling into our environment. Having more staff can create scenarios where each individual can look at one part of the ship and ensure that there are no leaks and etc. I believe that double checking everything before leaving the dock means fewer chances of accidents occurring, creating a better sea environment, and having a lower chance of our sea animals dying from consuming the oil that's in the ocean, and causing them to die.</p>

    <h1>Solution</h1>
    <p>Companies have a responsibility to ensure a safe space for the environment that they work in. They follow this by having a strong programme that ensures complete safety before beginning transportation. Along with this they must also have a plan for occurrences that happen at sea, and are able to repair them immediately. When these measures are not taken into accountability, it shows the priorities of the company, this being the money and not the safety of the environment and the lives involved. This includes family, workmates and other employees.</p>
